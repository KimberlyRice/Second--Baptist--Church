		<p>Small in numbers...Big in heart...At SECOND BAPTIST CHURCH, our goal is to help guide our members through their journey of spiritual growth.  We do that by offering a comforting environment, a shoulder to lean on and someone to listen in a supportive community.  With open-mindedness, friendship and an uplifting message, SECOND BAPTIST CHURCH promises to be a home base  for you to start your relationship with Christ and your spiritual growth journey.  We'll help you grow spiritually through the preaching of God's Word, prayer and meditation </p>



		<p> In a community rich with history, the Town Clock Church stands out as a truly significant structure connected to the Underground Railroad in the metro area.  The building served as a beacon of hope to freedom seekers across the river.  It was a connecting point between a slave state and a free state in a metro area, and a single stop on a long journey to freedom for many.

		Our mission is to preserve and enhance the structure for future generations and help tell the story of the people that worshipped here, took a stand against the evils of slavery, and helped those who passed through on their way to freedom.</p>
